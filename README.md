# LISA
This model was developed to assess the viability of US Lithium supply from geothermal brine and the potential supply chain impact of extracting Lithium from this source. This model links global demand and supply of lithium (Li) considering different electric vehicle (EV) demand scenarios. We seek to answer the following questions: • What is the economic potential of Li extraction from US geothermal sources? • Is geothermal Li extraction technology a viable investment in the US? • What is the potential supply chain impact of Li supply from US geothermal sources?


# SOFTWARE
The application is built using Venapps, which is special user interfaces that makes it easier for users to interact with Vensim models. Users thus have to have a current Vensim license to open and run it.

The files present are all important and need to be present for the model to run. More information on the files type can be found at https://www.vensim.com/documentation/file_types.html?q=lst.

Here are the steps to follow to run the model: 
1.	Open the mdl. file.
2.	Click on VCD button (2nd to last option on the left of the bar). A window will open.
3.	Double-click on the vcd. file. 
4.	Click on the "Run Venapp" at the bottom of the page. The application will run.
